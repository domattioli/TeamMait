If there are concerns about the SUDS skill, here are a few thoughts:\n\n- **Review Technique**: Ensure that the therapist is effectively guiding the client in using the SUDS scale. This includes clearly explaining how to rate their distress and encouraging them to reflect on their feelings.\n- **Practice and Reinforcement**: If the client struggles with SUDS ratings, consider incorporating more practice in future sessions to build their confidence and understanding of the scale.\n- **Feedback Loop**: Encourage the therapist to ask for feedback from the client about their comfort with the SUDS process, which can help identify any misunderstandings or difficulties.\n- **Monitor Progress**: Keep track of SUDS ratings over time to assess whether the client is becoming more adept at using the scale, which can inform adjustments in the therapeutic approach.\n\nWould you like to discuss this further or move on to the next step?",
