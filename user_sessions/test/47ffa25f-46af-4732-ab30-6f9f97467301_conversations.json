      "content": "Assertion: The therapist effectively utilized open-ended questions to facilitate client reflection and deepen the exploration of feelings related to the imaginal exposure.\n\nExplanation: By employing open-ended questions, the therapist encourages the client to articulate their thoughts and emotions, promoting a deeper understanding of their progress and experiences.\n\nContext from transcript:\nThe therapist asks, \"How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?\" [Line 1], which invites the client to share their emotional state. Additionally, the question, \"What's coming up for you as you reflect on that progress?\" [Line 15] further encourages the client to explore their feelings in relation to their progress. The inquiry, \"How do these feelings compare to when the earthquake first happened?\" [Line 9] also prompts the client to make connections between past and present experiences, fostering insight. These questions exemplify the therapist's skill in guiding the conversation while maintaining focus on the client's emotional journey.",
