      "content": "- The therapist effectively prompts the client's internal experience by asking, \"What's your biggest takeaway from today's session?\" [Line 23]. This encourages reflection and personal insight, which is a key aspect of fostering self-awareness in therapy.\n\n- The therapist also checks in with the client by asking, \"Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?\" [Line 27]. This reinforces the client's agency and invites them to share any lingering thoughts or feelings, further supporting their internal processing.\n\n- The closing statement, \"Alright. Let's end here for today. Take care.\" [Line 29], while brief, provides a sense of closure to the session, which can be important for the client\u2019s emotional state as they reflect on their experience.\n\nOverall, these behaviors suggest a consistent effort to engage the client in their internal experience and reinforce their contributions throughout the session.",
