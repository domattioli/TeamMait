Based on the lines you shared, here are some observations:\n\n- The therapist asks open-ended questions, such as \"What helps you on those harder days?\" [Line 19] and \"What's your biggest takeaway from today's session?\" [Line 23]. This approach encourages the client to reflect deeply on their experiences and insights.\n\n- The therapist also inquires about the client's emotions with \"What emotions are you experiencing as you sit with these sensations?\" [Line 7]. This question seems aimed at helping the client connect with their feelings, which can be important for processing trauma.\n\n- The question \"What's coming up for you as you reflect on that progress?\" [Line 15] suggests the therapist is facilitating the client's self-reflection on their growth, which may support the client's journey toward resilience.\n\nThese behaviors align with fostering a supportive therapeutic environment, encouraging exploration, and promoting client agency. If you\u2019d like to dive deeper into any specific aspect or have other questions, feel free to ask!",
