      "content": "It's important to consider the evidence from the transcript when evaluating the therapist's focus on imaginal exposure. The therapist's questions, such as \"How do these feelings compare to when the earthquake first happened?\" [Line 9] and \"How does sharing your experience make you feel?\" [Line 21], encourage the client to reflect on their emotional responses in relation to their traumatic experience. This aligns with the principles of prolonged exposure therapy, which aims to help clients process their trauma by discussing their feelings and memories in a safe environment.\n\nIf you have a different perspective or specific points you'd like to discuss regarding the therapist's approach, please share them, and we can analyze those aspects together."
