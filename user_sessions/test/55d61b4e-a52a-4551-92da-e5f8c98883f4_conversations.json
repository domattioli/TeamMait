      "content": "The therapist's ability to maintain focus on imaginal exposure is evident throughout the session. For instance, the therapist prompts the client to reflect on their progress in managing anxiety related to past traumatic experiences, as seen in their question, \"What's coming up for you as you reflect on that progress?\" [Line 15]. This inquiry encourages the client to engage with their experiences in a way that aligns with the principles of prolonged exposure therapy, reinforcing the therapeutic focus.\n\nAdditionally, the therapist's follow-up question, \"How do you see these experiences shaping your future?\" [Line 17], further emphasizes the relevance of the client's past experiences to their current and future coping strategies. By steering the conversation towards the client's development and coping mechanisms, the therapist ensures that the discussion remains rooted in the PE framework.\n\nThe therapist also checks in with the client about their readiness to conclude the session, asking, \"Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?\" [Line 27]. This demonstrates an awareness of the session's structure while allowing for any last-minute reflections that may still pertain to the exposure work.\n\nOverall, the therapist's questions and prompts consistently align with the goals of imaginal exposure, ensuring that the conversation remains focused and relevant to the client's therapeutic progress. This approach effectively supports the client's exposure gains without diverging into unrelated topics.",
