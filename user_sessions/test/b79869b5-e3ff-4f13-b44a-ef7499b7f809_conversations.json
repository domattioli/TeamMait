      "content": "Assertion: The therapist effectively utilized open-ended questions to facilitate the client's exploration of emotions and thoughts related to the imaginal exposure.\n\nExplanation: Open-ended questions encourage deeper reflection and allow the client to articulate their experiences, which is essential in therapy.\n\nContext from transcript:\nThe therapist asked, \"How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?\" [Line 1], which invites the client to share their emotional response. Additionally, the question, \"What's coming up for you as you reflect on that progress?\" [Line 15], further promotes exploration of the client's thoughts and feelings. The inquiry, \"How do these feelings compare to when the earthquake first happened?\" [Line 9], also encourages the client to make connections between past and present experiences, facilitating insight and understanding. Overall, these questions demonstrate the therapist's skill in guiding the session while remaining focused on the client's emotional journey.",
