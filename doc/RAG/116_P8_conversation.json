    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my body is still there, in that moment. My hands are trembling a little, and I can feel my heart racing. It's strange because I know I'm safe here, but my body hasn't quite caught up with that fact yet.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt during that earthquake. The ground was shaking so violently, and I couldn't do anything to stop it. I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how I'm going to die.\" And then, when the shaking finally stopped, I was trapped under some debris. I couldn't move, and I didn't know if anyone would find me. It's... it's overwhelming to think about.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does recalling that memory affect you physically?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's a weight pressing down on it. I'm having trouble taking deep breaths. And my muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and neck. It's almost like my body is preparing for another earthquake, even though I know it's not happening right now.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing as you sit with these sensations?",
    "Client: Fear is the strongest emotion. It's not as intense as it was during the actual event, but it's definitely there. There's also a sense of... I guess you could call it survivor's guilt. I made it out alive, but so many others didn't. And then there's anger. I'm angry that this happened, that nature can be so destructive and uncaring.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the earthquake first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as overwhelming now. Back then, it was like being hit by a tidal wave of emotions. I couldn't process anything; I was just reacting. Now, it's more like... like I'm observing the emotions rather than being completely consumed by them. It's still difficult, but I feel like I have a bit more control.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that sense of control?",
    "Client: It's... it's empowering, in a way. I mean, I still feel the fear and the anxiety, but I'm also aware that I'm here, in this room, safe. I can remind myself that I survived, that I got through it. And that knowledge... it helps me feel stronger, even when the memories are vivid.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience relate to your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it shows me that I'm making progress. A few months ago, I couldn't even talk about the earthquake without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, I can revisit the memory and, while it's still painful and scary, I'm able to stay present. It's like... like I'm slowly reclaiming parts of myself that I thought I'd lost in the disaster.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you reflect on that progress?",
    "Client: A mix of things, really. There's a sense of pride, I suppose. I've worked hard to get to this point, and it hasn't been easy. But there's also a feeling of... of grief. Grief for the person I was before the earthquake, for the sense of safety I lost. And yet, there's also hope. Hope that I can continue to heal, to grow stronger. It's a complex tangle of emotions.",
    "Therapist: How do you see these experiences shaping your future?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough question. I think they've made me more resilient, in a way. I know now that I can survive incredibly difficult situations. But they've also made me more anxious, more aware of how fragile life can be. I'm trying to find a balance between being prepared for the worst and not letting fear control my life. I want to use this experience to become stronger, to maybe even help others who've been through similar traumas. But it's a process, and some days are harder than others.",
    "Therapist: What helps you on those harder days?",
    "Client: Talking about it, like we're doing now. It helps to put words to what I'm feeling, to make sense of it all. And... and practicing the coping techniques we've worked on. Deep breathing, grounding exercises, they really do make a difference. Sometimes, I'll call my daughter or a friend, just to hear a friendly voice. And oddly enough, gardening has been therapeutic. There's something about nurturing life, watching things grow, that helps counteract the destruction I witnessed.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing your experience make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. For a long time, I felt so alone in this. Like no one could possibly understand what I'd been through. But talking about it, whether it's here in therapy or with my support group, it helps me feel less isolated. It's still difficult, and sometimes I struggle to find the right words, but overall, it feels like I'm lightening the load a bit each time I share.",
    "Therapist: What's your biggest takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that healing isn't linear. There are still moments when the memories feel overwhelming, but I'm better equipped to handle them now. And each time I face these memories, like we did today, I feel a little bit stronger. It's a reminder that while I can't change what happened, I can change how I respond to it. And that... that feels like progress.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done some hard but necessary work. My heart rate has slowed down, and I feel more grounded. There's a calmness that wasn't there at the beginning of our session. I'm proud of myself for getting through this, and I'm grateful for your guidance and support.",
    "Therapist: Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I feel like we've covered a lot of ground today. I'm looking forward to practicing some of the coping strategies we've discussed, especially when I feel those anxious thoughts creeping in. And I'm... I'm actually feeling a bit more optimistic about my ability to handle future challenges. It's not easy, but I think I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's end here for today. Take care."
