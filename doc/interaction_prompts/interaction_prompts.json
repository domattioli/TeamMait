      "assertion": "The therapist maintained focus on imaginal exposure throughout the session, keeping discussion on task and within the PE framework.",
      "explanation": "This consistency ensures exposure gains aren’t diluted by unrelated conversation.",

      "id": "procedural_01",
      "label": "Procedural",
      "assertion": "The therapist transitioned into processing once the client’s distress had subsided and they described feeling calmer and more grounded.",
      "explanation": "This timing reflects PE guidance to process after adequate emotional activation and decline.",
      "invitation": "Would you agree this pacing supported an effective transition from exposure to processing?"

      "id": "relational_01",
      "label": "Relational",
      "assertion": "After the client shared guilt and anger, the therapist offered brief validation before returning to exposure content.",
      "explanation": "That balance maintains rapport while preserving treatment structure.",
      "invitation": "Would you like me to provide an analysis on how effectively rapport and empathic connection were established across the session?"

      "id": "structural_01",
      "label": "Structural",
      "assertion": "The therapist closed the session shortly after processing, summarizing key themes without re-entering exposure content.",
      "explanation": "This closure helps consolidate learning and ensures emotional containment.",
      "invitation": "Does this seem consistent with effective PE structure and session pacing?"
