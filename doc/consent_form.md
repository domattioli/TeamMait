### Study Purpose
This research study investigates how artificial intelligence can enhance clinical supervision and training in therapy settings. We are studying how the *format* and *tone* of AI feedback influence clinicians’ engagement, agreement, and perceptions of usefulness.

### What You Will Do
- **Review Process:** Interact with *TeamMait* while reviewing a simulated therapy transcript  
- **Two Interaction Phases:** Open-ended chat and guided observation tasks  
- **Brief Surveys:** Complete short questionnaires about your experience  
- **Time Commitment:** About **45–60 minutes**, all online  

### Data Collection & Privacy
- **Interaction Logging:** All chat and survey data are recorded for research analysis  
- **Anonymization:** Your identity is removed from all research outputs  
- **Data Security:** Data are stored in a secure, encrypted AWS database managed by Penn State  
- **No Clinical or Identifying Information:** Do not share personal or client details  
- **Data Retention:** If you withdraw, existing data will remain in the dataset  

### Risks and Discomforts
Minimal risk. Some transcripts include trauma-related but non-graphic content. You may skip items or stop at any time without penalty.

### Benefits
No direct benefit. Findings will help design safer and more effective AI systems for clinician training.

### Your Rights
- **Voluntary:** Participation is optional and may be ended at any time
